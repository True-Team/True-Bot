<section class="introduction">
	<h1>Just a quick introduction about us and the project</h1>
	<p>We're a small team of students and developers who want to make Discord a better place with the new technologies.
		<b>During the Covid-19 Pandemic Emergency, we've started working on a project that could help students,
			teachers,
			workers, employees and employers to interact in the easiest way possible with the Discord platform.</b>
		After making
		some online researches, we found that the most common programming languages, like Python JavaScript, Go etc...
		provide some interesting APIs that perfectly work with Discord.
